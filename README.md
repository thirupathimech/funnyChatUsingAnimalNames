# Jolly Generator 😂

A fun, no-nonsense web app that takes your name and a number, and churns out a list of light-hearted, teasing phrases about you. Because who needs boring, serious generators anyway? This project is all about a good laugh and a clean, modern UI.

## ✨ Features

* **Joking Vibe**: The entire app is designed to be a bit "kindaal panra maari" (teasing), with humorous button text and funny output.
* **Modern UI**: Built with a playful, modern design using Tailwind CSS. It's got bold colors, a quirky font (`Comic Neue`), and a cool animated card effect.
* **Dynamic Output**: Enter your name and a number, and the app instantly generates a list of comical statements just for you.
* **Simple to Use**: Just type and click. The interface is clean and straightforward, so you can get right to the fun.
* **One-Click Copy**: Easily copy all the generated text to your clipboard with a single click.
